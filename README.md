# Multiple_linear_regression
Multiple linear regression is implemented, where a variable is dependent on 2 or more independent variables. Here the regression equation is Y=b0+b1*x1+b2*x2, where b0 is the intercept and b1, b2 are partial regression coefficients and x1, x2 are features (independent variables).
